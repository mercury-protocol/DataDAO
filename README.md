# Mercury Data DAO contracts

This repository contains the Mercury Data DAO smart contract and a factory for quickly deploying additional Data DAOs.  
The DAO members upload files to Filecoin, add the cids to the DAO contract. Once the admin approved the cids they become part of the DAO's offering on the protocol.  
The contract exposes a function which allows an admin to create a data sell order on the Mercury Protocol.  
The contract also exposes a function which allows the admins to distribute the DAO's earnings among the DAO members.

## Example contracts deployed onto the Hyperspace testnet:
Mercury DAO Factory: 0xE181AB214a28Ca5e768A2Ea4Dc45A94C59168061
